#  Keylogger
## Description
- This repository contains a Python-based key logger that logs keystrokes to a text file (`keylogger.txt`). It includes additional scripts (`script.vbs` and `script.bat`) to execute the logger silently.

## How It Works
- `key_logger.py`: Python script using `pynput` library to capture keystrokes.
- `script.bat`: Batch script to launch the Python script.
- `script.vbs`: VBScript to run `script.bat` silently.

## Usage
1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Run `script.vbs` to start logging keystrokes.
3. Press `Esc` to stop the key logger.

## Example
`batch`
C:\path\to\key-logger-repo> script.vbs

# Notes

- The key logger logs keystrokes to keylogger.txt in the current directory.
- Ensure you have appropriate permissions before running the logger.
# Legal
- This key logger is intended for educational purposes only. Use responsibly and only with explicit consent.
